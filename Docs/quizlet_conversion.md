# How To Generate Flash Cards!

First and foremost thank you for studying using the Quizzr App made by Aiden Allen. This should be a relatively simple tutorial, So lets get into it!

First we need to get our set from quizlet. Go to your set and locate the export button. This should be under the three dots button within your flash card set. Now generate a text file using the Comma option as a delimiter between word and definition and the newline option seperating the cards.

Now we need to create a new text file. Name this file anything you would like as it is completely temporary. 

Now return to the Quizet_Converter directory and run the following command.

```sh
python3 Convert.py <YourFile.txt> <NewFileName.txt>
```

Just like that you have migrated your quizlet flash cards to the German Quizzr Application!
